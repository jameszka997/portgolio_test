Hello there,
I am János, also known as "Jamesz"! I have a technical background and hold a dual Master of Science/Engineering degree in Biotechnological & Pharmaceutical Sciences with a Major in Bioprocess Engineering. I have a deep seated interest & experience in data analysis & science as I have held roles focusing on various facets of data
From developing bionformatic pipelines to process Next-Generation Sequencing data, all the way to creating Power BI-based tools for better decision making and data insight showcase.

--- 
Currently I am working on finishing my report dashboard for the analysis of [Drug Shortage cases within Hungary](https://github.com/jameszka997/Hungarian-Drug-Shortage-Data-Analysis), as well as finishing my Clinical Data Science Specialization certificate from University of Colorado.

You can find my CV [here](https://github.com/jameszka997/Data-Portfolio/blob/main/CV%20Data%20Analyst.pdf).


This repository aims to showcase my skills within data analytics, and as a platform to share any projects which I have worked on, so I may track my progress and improve myself within Data Analytics & Data Science related projects.


**Technical Skills:*****R, Python, SQL, Power BI, Excel, Linux Terminal, Veeva Vault***
